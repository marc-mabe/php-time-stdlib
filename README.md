# php-time-stdlib

Playground for new date and time standard library for PHP.

## State

**Very much early state!**

## Idea

The basic idea is to come up with a nice and clean API first
and make it available as plain PHP library.

Then implement as PHP extension in C.

And last create and RFC to hopefully get it into PHP core.
